<div class="content">
	<h2>Don't like it? Too bad.</h2>
	<p>BS2 used to have a "responsive" css file you could add in. BS3 is much more flexible and let's you really tailor the view to every device it will be viewed on.</p>
	<p>What this means for you is:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>You'll have to think about the mobile before/while thinking about the desktop experience.</li>
		<li>You're stuff will look good on mobile without you having to think about it.</li>
		<li>You're clients/customers will be happy because it looks good on their iWhatever.</li>
		<li>You can start thinking about what content/media is <em>most important,</em> and add extra stuff in later.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Again, Bootstrap is not for everyone or every project, but before starting on your project think about how many mobile users you might lose.</p>
